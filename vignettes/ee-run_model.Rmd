In this section we work to combine the components of Sections 1-3 to answer questions  of interest for each city given best available evidence, and to quantify the value of potential further research. After the loading of model functions (section 4.0 below), analysis takes place over two subcomponents - deterministic model analysis of combinations of interventions and deterministic model analysis of single interventions. We also conduct a probability sensitivity analysis (PSA) for each subcomponent. This work produces standard CEA results and quantifies the uncertainty of our inputs and decisions. 

# 4.0 Load model functions {-}

In this component we run several R scripts to load the model functions necessary for deterministic model runs and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). First we load our baseline workspace using *CascadeCEA-Interventions-1-LoadBaselineWorkspace.R* found in the *R* directory. This involves loading the needed R packages from libraries, and setting base model values (ie. interventions and CEA parameters, set time period, time steps, discount rate etc.). Some key base model values and what they are currently set to are provided in Table \@ref(tab:base-model-values).

| **Description**                   | **R name**        | **Value** |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------:|:---------:|
| Intervention sustainment duration | `int.sus`         | 10        |
| Start year                        | `int.first.year`  | 2020      |
| End of projection year            | `lyr`             | 2040      |
| Scale up period                   | `scale.up.period` | 18 months |
| Discount rate for cost and QALY   | `Discounting`     | 0.03      |

To load model base functions (as detailed in Section 3.0), we use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-1-LoadFunctions.R*. Following this, we use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-1-LoadParameterWorkspace-Combination.R* to set global and free model parameters such as intervention scales and effectiveness, city and state level costs,  based on calibrated values for the respective parameter. Also in this script - we call model inputs from files named `Evidence-Inputs-Master.xlsx` and `Evidence-Inputs-Master-Ideal.xlsx` stored in the *data* directory, and initialize the model. Finally, we set parameter names using the *CascadeCEA-Interventions-1-ParNamesExportIntModel.R* script found in the *R* directory. 

We also load some secondary model functions which have been created to help produce plots and outputs with color, labels etc., use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-1-LoadSecondaryFunctions.R* from the *R* directory. 

# 4.1 Deterministic model run for combinations of interventions {-}

In this component (use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-2-RunModelAndAccum-Combination-Deterministic.R*), we draw on model functions and data loaded in previous sections to run a deterministic model for estimating accumulated costs and epidemiological outcomes of combinations of interventions for each city or all cities. Intervention outcome matrices are produced (`outcome.comb.mx`) [insert more details about the matrices produced, I see 3 - 1:6, 7:32 and 33:44]; a list of outcomes and respective R labels are provided \@ref(tab:det-model-outcomes) . Note that we considered a 20-year time horizon (2020–2040) to capture the long-term individual benefits of ART and second-order transmission effects. Both costs and QALYs were reported using a 3% annual discount rate.

# 4.2 Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) for combinations {-}

In this component we perform PSA on the deterministic model run done in component 4.2 to evaluate the extent of parameter uncertainty for each intervention. For each city, we used the 2000 best-fitting calibrated parameter sets from 10,000 calibration runs, sampling all non-calibrated parameters simultaneously from distributions that were previously developed for each model parameter [cite]. Intervention outcome matrices are produced (`outcome.comb.SA.mx`), outcomes and respective labels in R are provided in Table \@ref(tab:det-model-outcomes). 

To run PSA on the optimal combination of implementation strategy (OCIS) use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-2-RunModelAndAccum-Combination-PSA-OCIS.R* which can be found in the *R* directory. 

To run PSA on the combinations proximal to the OCIS use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-2-RunModelAndAccum-Combination-PSA-Proximal.R* which can also be found in the *R* directory. 


# 4.3 Deterministic model run for single interventions {-}
This component estimates accumulated costs and epidemiological outcomes for a *single* intervention rather than a combination of interventions (use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-2-RunModelAndAccum-SingleIntervention-Deterministic.R*). This component is similar to component 4.2 in the sense that we draw on model functions and data loaded in Sections 1-3. Intervention outcome matrices are produced (`outcome.int.mx”`) [insert more details about the matrices produced, I see 3 - 1:6, 7:32 and 33:44]; outcomes and respective R labels are found in Table \@ref(tab:det-model-outcomes). Once again, one can choose to generate outputs for a single city or all cities. 

# 4.4 Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) for single interventions {-}

In this component we perform PSA on the deterministic model run in component 4.4 to evaluate the extent of parameter uncertainty for a single intervention.  Intervention outcome matrices are produced (`outcome.int.SA.mx`), outcomes and respective labels in R are provided in Table \@ref(tab:det-model-outcomes). Use *CascadeCEA-Interventions-2-RunModelAndAccum-SingleIntervention-PSA.R* found in the *R* directory.
